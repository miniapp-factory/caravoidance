A stylized open book with pages forming a subtle heart shape, surrounded by a circle of light, rendered in a modern minimalist style. The background features a gradient from deep blue at the top to teal at the bottom, giving a calm yet engaging atmosphere. The book’s spine is slightly visible, and the pages have gentle shadows to suggest depth. The overall composition is clean, with ample white space, and the design is suitable for use as a logo on a web application.
